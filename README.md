# SynFloodDoS
This tool is a multi-threaded TCP SYN flooder designed for stress-testing networks by overwhelming a target with SYN packets. It allows users to specify a remote host, port, and the number of threads to use for sending SYN packets concurrently, simulating a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.
